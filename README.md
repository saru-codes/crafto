# Crafto

Crafto is a Laravel-based, SaaS-capable website builder platform.

## Why Crafto?
Building websites with WordPress often requires purchasing themes and plugins for every new project, which becomes costly and difficult to scale.  
Crafto solves this by providing a reusable website-building platform with built-in modules, templates, and tools — allowing websites to be created faster without recurring per-site theme or plugin expenses.

## Core modules (MVP)
- Page builder (section-based)
- Blog
- Listings directory (search + filters)
- Ecommerce (Stripe checkout)

## SaaS-ready (later)
- Subscription billing (Laravel Cashier)
- Team roles per tenant/site
- Domain mapping + SSL automation
- Plan limits (sites, storage, users)
